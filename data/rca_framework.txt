Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in Product Management:

1. Problem Identification: Clearly define the issue with specific metrics.
2. Data Collection: Gather relevant data points to understand the problem scope.
3. Hypothesis Formation: Create potential explanations for the observed issue.
4. Data Analysis: Test hypotheses against available data.
5. Root Cause Identification: Determine the fundamental causes.
6. Solution Development: Create targeted solutions addressing root causes.
7. Implementation Planning: Develop an action plan with clear ownership.

Common RCA frameworks include:
- Five Whys: Repeatedly asking "why" to drill down to root causes.
- Fishbone Diagram: Identifying causal factors in categories like People, Process, Technology.
- Pareto Analysis: Focusing on the vital few causes rather than the trivial many.

Effective RCA answers should:
- Begin with structured problem definition.
- Use data-driven approach rather than assumptions.
- Consider multiple hypotheses before concluding.
- Prioritize solutions based on impact and feasibility.
- Include measurement plan for solution effectiveness.
